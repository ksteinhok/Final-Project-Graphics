# fool Card

final graphics project after I couldn't present my paralax effect in Blender

for Graphics 370 w/ Dave Shreiner

inspired by a piece on CodePen.io

Features a floating Tarot card with a butterfly 'in' the card. the non-euclidean geometry is created with a green screen and second scene
only visible through the front of the card. I created all the assets excluding the noise used to generate texture on the card.
