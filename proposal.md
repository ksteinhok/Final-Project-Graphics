I would like to create a small self contained animation loop for my final project

I am hoping to create a spinning tarot card that will alternate between the major arcana cards with each rotation. I would like different textures to 
seamlessly appear when away from the viewer. If implementation goes smoothly I can add user interactivity like selecting a tarot and learning its meaning,
picking a random card from a deck, etc. If possible I would like to introduce effects like cell shading if given enough time.

week 1: create canvas viewport, create basic card size plane w/ rotating transformation / motion

week 2: create texture maps for card back, arcana cards

week 3: create background, dynamic camera movement(with limitations to not see texture swap)

week 4: polish, introduce particle effects if have enough time.
